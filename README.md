# Shopping-List-CRUD-App

### Try the Grocery App:


I developed a traditional memory game, integrating an array of fun animal emojis. Employing the Fisher-Yates algorithm, I meticulously shuffled these elements before dynamically appending them to individual divs, emulating distinct cards within the document structure. This implementation introduces a time-sensitive challenge, wherein players must complete the task before the expiration of the timer to avoid defeat.
